3.  Introduction

   The use of pluggable DWDM optics has been utilized in packet devices
   for many years, commonly referred to as IPoDWDM.  A new generation of
   pluggable DWDM optics utilizing coherent transmission are now being
   widely deployed by operators for a variety of use cases.  The
   pluggable DCO, external to the photonic line system, represents a
   disaggregated DWDM network with the DWDM circuit endpoints located in
   a packet device.  While some applications may not utilize a photonic
   optical network, there will continue to be applications where
   traditional optical line systems are utilized to create end to end
   photonic paths.

   According to the Packet Optical Integration (POI) draft
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability] in which ACTN hierarchy is
   deployed [RFC8453], the PNCs are in charge of controlling a single
   domain (e.g.  Packet or Optical) while the MDSC is responsible to
   coordinate the operations across the different domains having the
   visibility of the whole multi-domain and multi- layer network
   topology.

   [RFC8453] defines a controller based framework decomposing the
   control of networks to specific administrative or technology domains.
   The Packet Optical Integration (POI) draft
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability] defines the roles and
   responsibilities of network controllers participating in a multi-
   layer Packet and Optical network.

   The pluggable optics module residing in a packet device is under the
   management of the packet domain.  As such, the model defined in this
   document would typically be exposed by a packet network controller to
   a higher layer controller or orchestrator.  This is aligned to
   [I-D.poidt-ccamp-actn-poi-pluggable], extending
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability] in use cases where a pluggable
   DWDM optic resides in a packet layer device.

3.1.  Use Cases and Applicability

   The model presented in this document is to be used for configuration
   of optical services.  It is expected for the controller utilizing the
   model to support basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   operations.  Discovery of the optics inventory, optics capabilities,
   and state are covered in the following drafts below for informational
   purposes.  The information gathered using these models can be
   directly used by the model defined in this document.

   *  Optics Capabilities Discovery:
      [I-D.ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang]
   *  Packet Network Hardware Inventory:
      [I-D.yg3bp-ccamp-optical-inventory-yang]

3.1.1.  Multi-Domain Service Controller (MDSC)

   The MDSC can expose the model to allow multi-layer circuit
   provisioning.  The MDSC will consume the model to then render
   pluggable configuration intent to a downstream Packet Provisioning
   Network Controller (P-PNC) and communicate photonic circuit
   configuration intent to the Optical Provisioning Network Controller
   (O-PNC).  Each of these downstream configuration intents is optional,
   allowing the same model to be used by the MDSC to perform three
   provisioning use cases.

   *  Multi-Layer provisioning towards P-PNC and O-PNC
   *  Pluggable DCO DWDM endpoint configuration only towards P-PNC
   *  Photonic optical circuit only towards O-PNC

3.1.2.  Packet Provisioning Network Controller (P-PNC)

   The P-PNC exposes the model to allow configuration of pluggable
   optics within its scope of control.  The model exposed by the P-PNC
   is a subset of the complete model, containing the portions of the
   model applicable to the configuration of the pluggable.  The P-PNC
   will not consume the components of the model used for photonic
   optical line system provisioning.

   *Pluggable DWDM Transceiver:* Pluggable optics module capable of
   terminating a DWDM optical signal.  The transceiver may have a number

   Hierarchical Controller, as defined in [RFC8453]

   *PNC (Provisioning Network Controller):* Also known as a domain

6.2.  Optical Service and Global Parameters

   The 'optical service" container and its 'global-parameters" is used
   to define the optical service and common optical parameters which
   MUST match between the packet nodes participating in the service.

   The operational-mode is used similarly to [L1CSM].  It abstracts
   several optical configuration parameters to a single identifier.  As
   an alternative the model user may explicitly define optical
   configuration.  The parameter values are passed to the node by the
   P-PNC without modification.  The node SHOULD utilize the explicit
   configuration when both explicit configuration and an operational-
   mode are defined.

6.3.  Packet Node Configuration

   The optical-service-nodes list defines the nodes participating in the
   service.  The list can contain one or two elements.

6.3.1.  Port Optical Configuration

   The node-configuration container has two child containers.  The port-
   optical-configuration defines the configuration applied to the
   specific port on a node.  The port-id is a required component and is
   not defined in a standard format, it will be defined by the node
   naming conventions.

6.3.2.  Port Packet Configuration

   The port-packet-configuration defines packet-layer configuration to
   be optionally applied to the node.  Currently to support the LAG
   requirements defined in [POI-Pluggable], the LAG interface ID can be
   defined.  The configuration for the LAG ID MUST be translated by the
   P-PNC into the node configuration.  If no LAG has been defined a new
   LAG will be created.

7.  Additional Information (rename)

7.1.  Multi-Domain Service Controller (MDSC)

   The MDSC can expose the model to allow multi-layer circuit
   provisioning.  The MDSC will consume the model to then render
   pluggable configuration intent to a downstream Packet Provisioning
   Network Controller (P-PNC) and communicate photonic circuit
   configuration intent to the Optical Provisioning Network Controller
   (O-PNC).  Each of these downstream configuration intents is optional,
   allowing the same model to be used by the MDSC to perform three
   provisioning use cases.

   *  Multi-Layer provisioning towards P-PNC and O-PNC
   *  Pluggable DCO DWDM endpoint configuration only towards P-PNC
   *  Photonic optical circuit only towards O-PNC

7.2.  Packet Provisioning Network Controller (P-PNC)

   The P-PNC can expose the model to allow configuration of pluggable
   optics within its scope of control.  The model exposed by the P-PNC
   is a subset of the complete model, containing the portions of the
   model applicable to the configuration of the pluggable.  The P-PNC
   will not consume the components of the model used for photonic
   optical line system provisioning.

7.3.  Optical Provisioning Network Controller (O-PNC)

   In summary the pluggable parameters exchanged from O-PNC to MDSC to
   P-PNC for end to end service provisioning are:

   - Pluggable Service source port-ID
   - Pluggable Service destination port-ID
   - Central Frequency (Lambda) (common to source and destination)
   - TX Output power (source port-ID)
   - TX Output power (destination port-ID)
   - Operational-mode (compatible)
   - Vendor OUI
   - Pluggable part number (if the operational mode in not standard)
   - Admin-state (common ?)
